This is a simple slack bot used for test purpose.

Feel free to contribute !

## 1. How to contribute to the startup bot  
  

You can ask for an access to the repository on the **#github** channel  
on the Startup Berlin Slack group.

We will give you a slack bot integration token for your tests.

All changes should me made in a separate branch based on `develop`. Once your're satisfied about what you've done, please create a pull request to merge your actual branch into `develop`.

## 2. A few rules and tips

For the sake of science, please use the channel **einstein-bot** to run all your tests.

Since we already have 8 integrations, we currently have 2 tokens for bots (Slack limits ingetrations to 10 on free plans).  

If you need some help please use the **#github** channel or even better, create your own.

The Startup Berlin Slack Team.
